    "## Introduction  \n",
    "While Delhi has always been a food-loving with each region having its own special cuisine, they have never been very big on eating out in the past. But all that is changing now. The restaurant industry in Delhi has been growing at a rapid pace over the last decade or so and the growth story is set to continue for the next foreseeable future. Its increasing population, rapid urbanisation and growing awareness of western lifestyles and higher disposable income were some of the factors that contributed to the growth of the restaurant industry.\n",
    "  Property developers, online food platform companies are taking the advantage of this trend to build new restaurants to meet the demands. However not every restaurants marked success. There are few considerations particularly the location of the restaurant that determines that whether the mall will be a success or failure."
